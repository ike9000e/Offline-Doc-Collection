# Offline Documentation Collection

This repository is a database of documentation files generated for various libraries, projects, programs or converted from other documents.
Currently all files are in [CHM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Compiled_HTML_Help).
Though original files are created by other authors, eg. author of the project or library programmer, contents listed here are documents generated or converted by the owner of this github page. Usually new documents are extended by additions like new table of contents, alphabetical index of topics or new main page.

To view CHM files following programs can be used:
- [Kchmviewer](http://www.ulduzsoft.com/kchmviewer)
- [CHM Fox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chmfox/)
